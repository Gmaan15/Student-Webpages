Name: Gurman B

Hi! I’m Gurman, a junior student currently learning computer science. This year has been a mix of challenges and growth—I’ve improved a lot in coding, design, and problem-solving. I’ve worked on several projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned!

📖 A Paragraph About the Project and What You Learned Over the school year: I built a variety of projects that helped me understand web development. I started with basic HTML pages, moved on to styled layouts with CSS, and finished with interactive apps using JavaScript. These projects taught me how to plan, debug, and improve my code. I also learned the importance of clean design and user experience.

🌐 An Overview of Your Portfolio Site: My portfolio site is a place to showcase everything I’ve created this year. It includes an introduction about me, screenshots of my work, and links to live versions of each project. You’ll also find short write-ups explaining each project and what I learned from it. The goal of the site is to reflect my journey through learning web development.

🚀 Featured Projects with Short Descriptions 🎨 Color Switcher Game A simple game where you press buttons to switch the background color or let it change automatically. I used JavaScript events and timers to build it.

🖼️ Image Slider A carousel that lets users scroll through images smoothly. It taught me how to manipulate the DOM and use arrays to cycle through data.

🕒 Digital Clock A real-time clock that displays the current time and updates every second. I learned about working with JavaScript’s Date object and timing functions.
